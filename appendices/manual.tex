\chapter{Installation Instructions}

The simplest way to install the application is using the attached apk file (Android) or ipa (iOS).


Alternatively, you can build the application from source which requires to set up react native according to the guide found at React Native docs \footnote{https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html}. In that case, copy the \texttt{memsourceApp} folder to your computer and make sure to fetch all git submodules. The next step is to run \texttt{npm i} to install the dependencies from npm. Then run \texttt{react-native run-android} to have the android app installed on your device or emulator. Alternatively, use \texttt{react-native run-iOS} to install the app on iOS device or emulator. This will install the app in debug mode. Before running it, you will need to run the command \texttt{npm start} to start the React Native packager.
